       My name is Javier Esqueda, I am a second year business major at the University of California Riverside, and I intend to receive my Masters in Business Administration. I have already begun to learn many things in my short time there, and I continue to strive for more in the future. Although I am attending school in order to broaden my knowledge in business, I also intend to expand my horizons by incorporating courses in the technology field. The world is becoming more reliant on technology everyday and I believe that it is important to grasp a better understanding of it. I aspire to manage my own business in the future and I believe that the opportunities provided at the University of California Riverside will provide me with the best chance to do so. I am currently learning the basics of what it means to manage a business, but I feel that every step I take is getting me closer to career readiness. I am determined to achieve my goals and I am willing to put in the hard-work and extra effort to fulfill the path I have set for myself. Thus, I will take any chance I am provided with because these opportunities will only increase my chances for success in the future as well as contribute to the current skills and knowledge I have attained so far in college.    <br><br>

        I have already begun to work in the field, and I have learned various skills that will prove to be useful in the future. During my breaks I have been working for a company that operates on Amazon. I have learned valuable skills such as creating Amazon listings, customer relations, and quality control of products. Through these experiences I have been able to grasp a better understanding of what is expected from a company and as the owner. I have learned that the owner is ultimately responsible for any action that is made by the company, whether it is performed by them or not. At the same time an owner must look to the future in order to successfully grow the company, while attending to their own daily tasks and the tasks of their employees. Ultimately, this work experience has provided me with great insight to how the business world operates, as well as the character traits and skills that are necessary to compete in such a competitive environment. All of these tools are essential because they can only be learned through experience. This opportunity has provided me with skills that simply cannot be learned anywhere else but in the business world. Although I have learned a lot from this company I understand that I still have much more to learn, and I hope to learn more from these opportunities and the opportunities I will have in the future. I know that there are other jobs and internships that can provide me with other opportunities, hence I have an open-mind to any changes that may come in the future.
